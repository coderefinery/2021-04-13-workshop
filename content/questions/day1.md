## Workshop introduction

https://github.com/coderefinery/workshop-intro/blob/master/video.md

- How to change name on zoom?
  - click on participants, then next to your name there is "rename"
  
- How to exit the edit mode? I see it now, thanks
  - top right there is an "eye" button
  - sometimes the "eye" button is on the top left

- How do we access the recorded lessons? And for how long?
    - The recording will be available in Twitch (the streaming service we use) for two weeks. If possible (we have a clean recording), it will also be posted to youtube
    - we probably will also put them on youtube (https://coderefinery.org/lessons/#video-recordings) but this depends on some postprocessing to make sure nobody appears there who did not want to

- Should we leave answering questions here to coderefinery staff only, or should participants also try answering questions posed in hackmd?
    - Instructors and expert helpers are also learning here, so it might well be that participants have valuable input. Actually that is pretty much certain! So feel free to also participate in providing answers! :+1:
    - we will see that it will be interesting to sometimes see multiple different answers so please answer, comment, complete :+1:

- Will breakout rooms be recorded? May we unmute ourselves there? 
    - They will not be recorded.
    - We encourage unmuting and openly discussing/collaborating during the break out rooms.
    - If you are uncomfortable with this, then you of course do not have to use video/audio.


### Introduction to Git https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/

- Will we have breaks?
  - there was a coordination problem but for future sessions we plan 10 minutes every hour. sorry that this was not clearly communicated at this stage but we will communicate this more clearly for other workshop days.

- Awesome screen sharing of the instructor there:) 
  - Congrats to the instructor for the coolest setup
  - It is amazing. The future is here. I want this too.
  - Mad skills at mirrored writing ;)
  - I am jealous, rocking setup! +1
  - Woah! What an amazing way to make us understand the importance of version control

- What is the URL to the video the instructor showed?
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvbLVVRzJF8
    - love it!

- Once you undo from v3 to v2, is v3 completely lost?
    - one can do this in multiple ways in Git. Some are "unsafe" and throw away changes, while others are "safe" and allow you to always retrieve work. We will learn about this soon

- so a snapshot is like the doc v1.1. in the video?
    - Kind of! The version control snapshots have some extra features, like the information about from which snapshot it was derived (this solves the "I have a 1.2 but I think it's different than your 1.2"). And then later, when you for example feel like you want to release a specific version of your work (e.g. "this is the code with which the results in the paper were obtained"), many version control platforms, including GitHub, offer the option of releasing specific versions of the repository. So it might get a bit confusing to hold on to the "v1.1" thinking at that point, but the analogy is good for the moment.

- Is it a bad error? "Stopping at filesystem boundary (GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM not set)."
    - The git repository has not been created yet.  `git init` in the right place.
    - It's not possible to give a Single True Answer that covers all situations, but my first guess might be that you are perhaps initializing your git repository somewhere where there is already a lot of content, and perhaps e.g. other storage media (usb stick etc)
    - solution (probably/hopefully): create a folder first, step into it, `git init` inside the new folder

- Rather than typing `git add ....` two times (for different files), could we have not done `git add .` directly so that all the changes could've been saved at once?
  - Yes.  Sometimes we do things a certain way for demo purposes
  - Sometimes `add .` might add too much if it's not ignored (`git status` would hint at that).

- Do you always work from terminal? Are git GUIs really that useless?
  - no they are useful but we start in the terminal to get an understanding of what is really happening "underneath" but later we will also move to the web interface and mention other graphical interfaces. GUIs can be great for this
  - for example GitHub Desktop is quite good, or the online Gitpod.io. But to learn and understand the concepts, it is indeed good to learn the commands in a terminal. And most of the special and advanced options are only available as commands

- Git replaces LF with CRLF. Can there be a case where this becomes a problem?
    - No, as far as I know. This is because Windows and Linux use different line endings and git is adjusting to make them compatible. I have never seen it cause a problem.
    - For the purposes of this workshop, almos certainly not a problem
    - Does anyone remember how to _safely_ turn off this warning? Is `git config core.autocrlf true` always OK?
    - The command posted above didn't work for me. I'm still having the warning. But, if it doesn't cause any problems, it's supposed to be fine I guess.
      - we can also try to fix this later via screenshare when we have some time but it won't cause any trouble for the workshop 
    - It's correct to get the **warning**!üëçüèΩ And `core.autcrlf true` is the correct setting, always üòä

- My video is disable, can you enable it please?
  - Solved!
      - A host or co-host can click "ask to start video" 
      - great

- When saving and closing nano I get the message: 'Error in /usr/share/nano/git.nanorc on line 1: Regex strings must begin and end with a " character  - (other line) not understoodare/nano/git.nanorc on line 2: Command' and more. Any idea?
   - which operating system?
       - Win 10
   - I haven't seen this error before but it means that a file installed along with Nano contains unexpected characters so to me it looks like installation didn't go 100% well. We could look into that git.nanorc file to find out what characters confuse it, or ignore it or we could try a different editor.
   - Does it still save the file though?
       - Thank you, I can try a different editor; anyway, it does save the file. Adding and committing work well
       - vs code is working well, no strange errors

- Can I use other text editors than nano? What commands may I use for them?
    - You can use any text editor you prefer (both graphical and terminal-only). Which editors are available depends on your OS and environment. Which OS are you using?
        - Win 10
        - Good other alternatives on Win can be VS Code, Atom, or NotePad++. Here we show how you can connect Git to them: https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/shell-and-git/#step-2-setting-an-editor
        - Here we have overview of other editors: https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/editors/
        - Thanks very much! I have VS code; will configure that

- Isn't the GUI an option only if you push the commit to the remote repositpry? (Or if we start with the GUI from the remote repository in the first place)
    - not really. try typing git gui on your gitbash terminal on windows. you can do stages and commits via the gui. some text editors such as Atom, VScode also have git gui integrations even for local commits and changes. hope this answers you!
        - Thanks! Didn't know about this :)
        - TIL! nice


### Exercise

Exercise goals:
- start with an introduction
- redo this section on your side: https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/02-basics/#type-along-tracking-a-guacamole-recipe-with-git
- up to and including: https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/02-basics/#exercise-record-changes
- Ends at 10:25 CET, be back in main room then
- Have a 10 minute break
- for older zoom the "raise hand" is under participants instead of reactions

- how do we access the 'task instructions' page that Sabry is using?
    - Scroll up a bit to see links to this 
    - https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/02-basics/#exercise-record-changes 
    - has this answered the question? (because I didn't 100% understand the question but I was also distracted)
    - yes thanks!! :)

- Could you address this, please: warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in ingredients.txt.
    - see a bit above (same question), it is a warning about different line endings used by different OS and may be ignored for this workshop
    - Windows represents the end of a line differently than Linux, and it just converted between them. 

- I'm testing sharing my terminal, but how do I finish sharing? Can not find any button, nothing.
    - OK, I see now, there's a bar in the middle top of the whole screen area, not in the shared window.
    - There's likely a thin bar at the top or bottom of your zoom with "stop sharing" or something like that
    - it may vanish in between but can usually be found when moving mouse around at the edges of the screen
    - If you have multiple screens, the status bar might also show up on one of your secondary screens.


### Summary of Git basics

https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/02-basics/#summary


### The staging area

https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/04-staging-area/


#### Advantages and disadvantages of the git commit message examples

This is referring to https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/04-staging-area/#discussion

- pro of Example 2: independent features are in independent commits. Can cherry-pick.
    - Can be especially useful for debugging purposes if one of the features breaks something elsewhere. With approach #1, finding the feature that breaks things would be more difficult.
- Con of Example; good luck finding out what you actually did 2 years later.
- .
- .Ex1 and 2 both include the name of files that has been changed but nothing about the change (in Ex. 2)
- Pro of Example 4. Easy to find changes to specific features.                              
- .Ex4 con: Too much information! May be hard to track back
-  Con of example 4: hard for outsiders to understand and committing separate changes in the same commit
- Con of Ex.5 : No information at all! Just the date doesn't give one any idea as to what happened
  - also the date is anyway already tracked in metainformation 
- Example 2 is good for outsiders, since it says when some feature was implemented, and example 4 is good for the developer in order to keep track of everything, while the others are super bad
  - that's a great summary! because often we work as in 4 but may or many not want to clean up towards 2
    - right, in the end if everything is good it would be better to clean up! Thanks!
- Pro of 1: concise, but if features are very important could easily be lost if you search for the addition of a specific feature, 2 is pretty good, clear and easy to search back, 3 is useless because of the volume of things that are tied to this one commit, 4 is way to wordy and hard to track, 5 is not useful because date and what was done are not tracked elsewhere
    - will be a problem when these features become bugs :wink: 


#### More questions/comments

- What does "feature" mean?
  - A single (ideally independent) piece of functionality implemented in code. For example:
      - add a test for a function
      - adds a new function to plot a graph
      - replace an existing function to plot a graph
  - Content in a repository is not necessarily code. A feature could also be a new section in a text document or revisions from a proofreading of a text document. :+1: 

- Is there a keyboard shortcut for the clear command in the terminal?
   - One can define an alias for the commands that one is using often.
   - Control-L does it in some terminals (:+1: on OSX terminal & Git Bash on Win) :+1:
     - Control-L works! Thanks!

- AFAIK git only works with plaintext source files. Is it possible to use with word files somehow? :smile: 
  - git can work with any format but it is true that it works less well with huge binary files and also with non-plaintext files it will not show useful "diff"
  - thanks!
  - I am not a Word expert but in this case I would track the manuscript in some other format (like markdown or LaTeX or something plain text) and use conversion tools like pandoc to convert to Word if this helps communicating with co-authors who refuse to use other tools. 

- Why `git diff` or `git diff --staged` do not give any resuls?
    - if your repository is up to date (no change after last commit) there is nothing to show. 
    - use `git status` to check if there are any changes and whether your repository is up to date (works for both staged and unstaged changes)
    - also git diff shows changes in modified files, but does not show if you have e.g. added a whole new file.

- In the previous example we used git commit without using git add before. How does that work? Ok i see the explanation is just coming now :)
  - you can `git commit somefile` without staging first but in the long run, staging first (maybe multiple times) and committing in a second step can be a useful practice to review the staged (prepared) commit before committing it

- How can I see the difference between working dir and commited section? Is it possible?
  - if nothing is staged: `git diff`
  - if something is staged: `git diff HEAD` (because here a `git diff` would only show difference between staged and working dir)
  - not sure `HEAD` was explained yet but we will clarify latest tomorrow. Instead of `HEAD` you can also refer to the branch name (typically `master` or `main`; again more about it tomorrow)

- It says "git reset # unstages staged changes" but in the image, it shows reset: committed --> staged?
  - good catch! this is confusing and I think the text description is possibly not fully correct. will follow-up in an issue: https://github.com/coderefinery/git-intro/issues/293
  - to unstage I would use `git restore` as indicated there
      - but restore isn't even there at all :/
        - we need to update the image, `git restore` is relatively new 
      - the good news is that git will remind you of the command to use. If you do `git status` after you have staged some changes, git will tell you what command to use to unstage the changes 
  - and indeed `git reset --soft` can move from committed to staged

- I find this staging difficult to understand without hands on example.
    - Agree
    - exercise coming up :)
    - let us know if it is unclear after the exercise
